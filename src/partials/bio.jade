p Since playing their first show together in the summer of 2005, the Omaha-based rock act, After the Fall, has always sought to leave a lasting impression on the hearts and minds of  each and every person in the crowd.  Pinning down their own brand of  guitar driven rock with emotionally charged vocals, the band has previously earned a popular vote nomination for “best rock” by the Omaha Entertainment Awards alongside a place among mtvU’s top 25 unsigned artists.  
p In early 2012, After the Fall’s single, “Your Final Goodbye”, earned them a spot in regular rotation on the top Omaha rock station, 89.7 the River.  That same year the band was a supporting act for 89.7’s annual River Riot festival show headlined by Incubus.  ATF has also shared the stage in support of national acts Shinedown, Five Finger Death Punch, Papa Roach, Sick Puppies, and Coheed and Cambria. 
p Their 2014 release, “Empire”, highlights their growth within the genre while infusing new elements of electronic and pop.  Through their well-attended, chaotic live shows, the band continues to extend their reach across the midwest and beyond.
